[Chorus]
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything? Question everything

[Verse 1]
The world is a shit tip, your children are fucked
The ones you think guard you are out for your blood
Well, our minds are battered and washed out with static
But what exactly do you think you're gonna do?

[Pre-Chorus]
United we'll fail, divided we'll fall
We're fucked, but you're making it worse
United we'll fail, divided we'll fall
Give up 'cause you're making it so much worse

[Chorus]
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything? Question everything

[Verse 2]
Oh, give me a break, you deluded, ill-informed, self-serving pricks
If you really believe in the words that you preach
Get off your screens and onto the streets
There will be no peaceful revolution, no war without blood
You can say I'm just a fool that stands for nothing
Well, to that, I say you're a cunt, kick it

[Pre-Chorus]
United we'll fail (United we'll fail)
Divided we'll fall (Divided we'll fall)
United we'll fail
We're fucked, but you're making it worse

[Chorus]
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything? Question everything
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything? Question everything
